Module "Term1"     (component Term)
   - Term1_CRLF -Send CRLF to terminal.
   - Term1_SendStr -Send string to terminal.
   - Term1_SendNum -Send number to terminal.
   - Term1_SendChar -Send char to terminal.
   - Term1_Cls -Clear the terminal window.
   - Term1_MoveTo -Move cursor to position x, y. Range of coordinates can be from 1 to the size, which depends on the used 
                terminal. Position [1,1] represents the upper left corner.
   - Term1_SetColor -Set foreground and background color. The following color constant are defined in the header file:   
                clBlack - Black color   clRed - Red color   clGreen - Green color   clYellow - Yellow color   clBlue - Blue 
                color   clMagenta - Magenta color   clCyan - Cyan color   clWhite - White color
   - Term1_ReadChar -Read char from terminal.
   - Term1_KeyPressed -Test if char was received from the terminal.
   - Term1_ReadLine -Read string from the terminal. Waits until whole string is read. Method expects carriage return and line 
                feed (CRLF) escape sequence as a string termination.

Module "RedLED"    (component PWM)
   - RedLED_SetRatio16 -This method sets a new duty-cycle ratio. Ratio is expressed as a 16-bit unsigned integer number. 0 - 
                FFFF value is proportional to ratio 0 - 100%. The method is available only if it is not selected list of 
                predefined values in <Starting pulse width> property.   Note: Calculated duty depends on the timer 
                possibilities and on the selected period.
   - RedLED_SetDutyUS -This method sets the new duty value of the output signal. The duty is expressed in microseconds as a 
                16-bit unsigned integer number. The method is available only if it is not selected list of predefined values in 
                <Starting pulse width> property.
   - RedLED_SetDutyMS -This method sets the new duty value of the output signal. The duty is expressed in milliseconds as a 
                16-bit unsigned integer number. The method is available only if it is not selected list of predefined values in 
                <Starting pulse width> property.

Module "TU1"       (component TimerUnit_LDD)
   - TU1_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc. If the property <"Enable in init. code"> is set to 
                "yes" value then the device is also enabled (see the description of the <Enable> method). In this case the 
                <Enable> method is not necessary and needn't to be generated. This method can be called only once. Before the 
                second call of Init the <Deinit> must be called first.
   - TU1_GetPeriodTicks -Returns the number of counter ticks before re-initialization. See also method <SetPeriodTicks>. This 
                method is available only if the property <"Counter restart"> is switched to 'on-match' value.
   - TU1_GetCounterValue -Returns the content of counter register. This method can be used both if counter is enabled and if 
                counter is disabled. The method is not available if HW doesn't allow reading of the counter.
   - TU1_SetOffsetTicks -Sets the new offset value to channel specified by the parameter ChannelIdx. It is user responsibility 
                to use value below selected period. This method is available when at least one channel is configured.
   - TU1_GetOffsetTicks -Returns the number of counter ticks to compare match channel specified by the parameter ChannelIdx. 
                See also method <SetOffsetTicks>. This method is available when at least one channel is configured.
   - TU1_SelectOutputAction -Sets the type of compare match and counter overflow action on channel output. This method is 
                available when at least one channel is configured.

Module "BlueLED"   (component PWM)
   - BlueLED_SetRatio16 -This method sets a new duty-cycle ratio. Ratio is expressed as a 16-bit unsigned integer number. 0 - 
                FFFF value is proportional to ratio 0 - 100%. The method is available only if it is not selected list of 
                predefined values in <Starting pulse width> property.   Note: Calculated duty depends on the timer 
                possibilities and on the selected period.
   - BlueLED_SetDutyUS -This method sets the new duty value of the output signal. The duty is expressed in microseconds as a 
                16-bit unsigned integer number. The method is available only if it is not selected list of predefined values in 
                <Starting pulse width> property.
   - BlueLED_SetDutyMS -This method sets the new duty value of the output signal. The duty is expressed in milliseconds as a 
                16-bit unsigned integer number. The method is available only if it is not selected list of predefined values in 
                <Starting pulse width> property.

   - GreenLED_SetRatio16 -This method sets a new duty-cycle ratio. Ratio is expressed as a 16-bit unsigned integer number. 0 - 
                FFFF value is proportional to ratio 0 - 100%. The method is available only if it is not selected list of 
                predefined values in <Starting pulse width> property.   Note: Calculated duty depends on the timer 
                possibilities and on the selected period.
   - GreenLED_SetDutyUS -This method sets the new duty value of the output signal. The duty is expressed in microseconds as a 
                16-bit unsigned integer number. The method is available only if it is not selected list of predefined values in 
                <Starting pulse width> property.
   - GreenLED_SetDutyMS -This method sets the new duty value of the output signal. The duty is expressed in milliseconds as a 
                16-bit unsigned integer number. The method is available only if it is not selected list of predefined values in 
                <Starting pulse width> property.
